### File Structure Overview

- **dataset/:** This folder contains raw or processed datasets used for analysis or modeling.
- **images/:** Plots, graphs, and network diagrams (e.g., used in the report).
- **python_code/:** Main logic for machine learning and GCN modeling.
    - **data-processing.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook for cleaning, transforming, and preparing migration data.
    - **node-classification-with-cluster-gcn.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook implementing GCN for migration hub classification.
- **r_code/:**
    - **node-classification-with-cluster-gcn.R:** R script (or notebook) that possibly performs a similar analysis or alternative view in R.
- **gephi-project.gephi:** A Gephi project file for visualizing and analyzing migration networks.
- **README.md:** Project overview, instructions, and references for running the code and understanding the project.
